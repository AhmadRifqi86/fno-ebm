## 📊 Key Metrics Implemented

### Uncertainty Quantification (Critical for your work)

| Metric | What It Measures | Target | Importance |
|--------|------------------|--------|------------|
| **Calibration Error** | Predicted confidence vs actual coverage | < 0.05 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ PRIMARY |
| **CRPS** | Proper scoring rule for probabilistic predictions | Lower | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Coverage (90%, 95%)** | Empirical coverage of prediction intervals | ≈ Nominal | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Sharpness** | Average prediction interval width | Lower (but calibrated) | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Interval Score** | Combines sharpness + calibration | Lower | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **NLL** | Likelihood of ground truth | Lower | ⭐⭐⭐ |

### Physics Compliance (Your Advantage!)

| Metric | Formula | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **PDE Residual** | `||-∇·(a∇u) - f||²` (Darcy) | Shows physics-informed training works |
| **BC Violation** | `||u|∂Ω - g||²` | Validates constraint satisfaction |
| **Conservation** | `||∫u - ∫u₀||` | Checks physical laws |

### Accuracy (Baseline)

- MSE, MAE, Relative L2 Error

## 🔬 How to Use for Your Thesis

### Step 1: Evaluate Your Model

```bash
cd diagnostics
python example_evaluation.py
```

This generates:
- `evaluation_results/calibration_curve.png`
- `evaluation_results/uncertainty_heatmap.png`
- `evaluation_results/error_vs_uncertainty.png`
- `evaluation_results/prediction_intervals.png`
- `evaluation_results/metrics.json`

**Include these in your thesis!**

### Step 2: Compare with Baselines

```python
from diagnostics import ModelComparator

models = {
    'FNO-EBM (Yours)': your_model,
    'FNO-Dropout (Paper #1 style)': baseline_dropout,
    'Vanilla FNO': deterministic_fno
}

comparator = ModelComparator(models, test_data)
results = comparator.run_comparison()
comparator.print_summary()
```

Generates comparison table:

```
Model                 | MSE    | Calibration | CRPS  | Coverage_90 | Physics Residual
----------------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------------|------------------
FNO-EBM (Yours)       | 0.0012 | 0.042       | 0.015 | 0.89        | 0.0003
FNO-Dropout (Paper #1)| 0.0011 | 0.067       | 0.018 | 0.85        | 0.0012
Vanilla FNO           | 0.0010 | N/A         | N/A   | N/A         | 0.0008
```

**This table goes in your thesis!**

### Step 3: Generate Figures for Paper

```python
from diagnostics import plot_comparison_radar, plot_reliability_diagram

# Radar chart comparing all methods
plot_comparison_radar(
    {name: results[name]['metrics'] for name in models.keys()},
    save_path='figures/comparison_radar.png'
)

# Reliability diagram (calibration curves for all methods)
plot_reliability_diagram(
    predicted_coverage_array,
    actual_coverage_array,
    method_names=list(models.keys()),
    save_path='figures/reliability_diagram.png'
)
```

## ✅ What You Can Now Claim (Honestly)

### Strong Claims (Backed by Metrics)

✅ **"Our method provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates"**
   - Show calibration error < 0.05
   - Show coverage ≈ nominal levels

✅ **"Physics-informed training improves solution quality"**
   - Show PDE residual significantly lower than baselines
   - Ablation: FNO alone vs FNO+Physics

✅ **"Competitive with state-of-the-art probabilistic operators"**
   - Show CRPS comparable to Papers #1, #2
   - Show better on ≥1 metric (likely physics residual)

### Honest Limitations (Must Report)

❌ **"Higher computational cost than dropout-based methods"**
   - Report inference time comparison
   - Explain trade-off: better calibration but slower

⚠️ **"Calibration degrades outside training distribution"**
   - Test on out-of-distribution data
   - Report honestly

⚠️ **"Method requires careful hyperparameter tuning"**
   - Document σ² sensitivity
   - Provide tuning guidelines

## 🎓 For Your Thesis Defense

### Questions You'll Get

**Q: "How does your calibration compare to existing methods?"**
**A:** Show the calibration curve (from diagnostics). Point out your error is X%, Paper #1 is Y%.

**Q: "What's the computational cost of your method?"**
**A:** Show inference time from comparison table. Acknowledge it's slower but explain why (MCMC sampling).

**Q: "How do you know your uncertainty is meaningful?"**
**A:** Show error vs uncertainty correlation plot. High correlation means uncertainty is predictive of error.

**Q: "Why not just use dropout like Paper #1?"**
**A:** Show physics residual comparison. Your method respects physics better.
