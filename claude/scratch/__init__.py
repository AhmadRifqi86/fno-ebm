scratch - FNO-EBM from-scratch implementation

This package contains a from-scratch implementation of FNO-EBM (Fourier Neural
Operator with Energy-Based Models) for uncertainty quantification in PDE solutions.

All components including MCMC samplers, Contrastive Divergence loss, and
Persistent Contrastive Divergence are implemented from scratch without relying
on external EBM libraries.
